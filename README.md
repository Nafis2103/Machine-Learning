# Machine-Learning
I have started Machine learning 
In my first class I have learned how machine learning became a neccessity in our mordern world and what is the difference in ai ml and dl . We are just trying to create sub_brain of our brain we are finding just pattern behaviour . How our brain will think in case of a pattern behaviour so that if i want to select a special pattern behaviour i cant go through all the data so i will build a machine and train that machine to do that for us . Rather than writing rules for every possible pattern just provide the data and machine will do itself . 
DEEP LEARNING :
A class of algorithm  , it is a machine learning , inspired by biology . It is a mathametical part . Why use this ? In machine learning i have to provide features . Deep learning can learn deeper . Deep learning improves the data after 
Why use machine learning : 
you will not use a sowrd to kill the bee .
