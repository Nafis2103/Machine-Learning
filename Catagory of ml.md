# Catagories
Supervised machine_learning - 
1.regression 
2.classification 
it is all about machine learning . we have some data of students . 1.data 2. cgpa 3. y/n placement 
iq  cgpa  y/n 
87  7.1   1 
111 8.9   1 
75  6.3   0 
we are to draw a mathematical realtion between cgpa and iq that will give me the resiult . 
1 . regression - 
We need to understand data types .
Numerical -(age,iq , cgpa ) 
this is regressiion 
2. Classification -
Catagorical data -(gender , nationality )
UNSUPERVISED ml : 
unsupervised meaning we have just input 
iq  cgpa 
87  7.1    
111 8.9    
75  6.3   
no output here is given . 
1. clustering
2. dimensiality reduction
3. anomoly detection
4. association rule learning
--------------------------
1. Clustering -
it is used a lot , To make groups in data .
2. Dr :
much more input coloumn will reduce the accurecy . marging coloumn is called feature extraction . Algo(PCA) . more dimension in data we have to calculate just 3 dimension . so we need to merge the data and come down in three  dimension . 
Semi supervised learning :
unsupervised learning gives me the relation i have to selct what is the output .
