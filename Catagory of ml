Supervised machine_learning - 
1.regression 
2.classification 
it is all about machine learning . we have some data of students . 1.data 2. cgpa 3. y/n placement 
iq  cgpa  y/n 
87  7.1   1 
111 8.9   1 
75  6.3   0 
we are to draw a mathematical realtion between cgpa and iq that will give me the resiult . 
1 . regression - 
We need to understand data types .
Numerical -(age,iq , cgpa ) 
this is regressiion 
2. Classification -
Catagorical data -(gender , nationality )
